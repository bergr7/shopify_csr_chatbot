Balasubramanian, associate dean and professor of marketing at Illinois Tech’s Stuart School of Business, explains that the onset of multiple data sources to gather and merge data about customers, products, and markets is a common problem for today’s businesses.\\xa0\\n\\n“Analytics offers useful techniques to handle this problem by organizing data to develop metrics that are most useful for continuously monitoring business performance,” Balasubramanian says. “The focus of analytics is on issues that matter most to the business, and the performance metrics are helpful in identifying and solving problems in real time.”\\n\\nData points can tell you a story about the total number of visitors to your site in a given week. For example, maybe only 50% enjoyed your website enough to spend more than even a few seconds on it. And maybe only half of those who stayed actually made a purchase, while another 10% got stuck in the checkout process, became frustrated, and left.\\n\\nThat’s the story of a group of individuals who took very different actions on your online store.\\xa0\\n\\nUntil you know the\\xa0_whole_\\xa0story, you can’t change the ending.

For example, if your typical client comes back to your store three times to buy something, spends, on average, $100 per purchase, and your\\xa0profit margin\\xa0is 10% ($10), that customer’s CLV is $30.\\xa0\\n*   **Returning visitors.**\\xa0The percentage of users who return to your site after their first visit. This number is a clear indication that people liked what they saw.\\xa0\\n*   **Time on site.**\\xa0The average amount of time users spend on your site per visit. If people are spending time on your site, it shows they’re having a good customer experience.\\n*   **Pages per visit.**\\xa0The average number of pages users navigate on your site in a single visit. A high number of pages per visit (around four) indicates people are interested in what you’re selling.\\n*   **Bounce rate.**\\xa0The percentage of users who visit a single page on your website and leave before taking any action. A high bounce rate (usually higher than 57%) means your site is not giving a good first impression. A user may bounce because of poor design, unmet expectations, or slow page-loading time.\\n\\nWith the exception of CLV, which you need to calculate yourself, the above metrics can easily be accessed through\\xa0Google Analytics. They appear on the first page, as soon as you log in.\\n\\nIf any of your metrics are below average, try putting yourself in the shoes of your customer, brainstorm ideas for improving your site, and test solutions until you see those numbers start moving up.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

On average, the\\xa0ecommerce conversion rate\\xa0for stores is between 1% and 4%.\\n*   **Page load time.**\\xa0When your pages take too long to load, conversion rates will be affected, which will have a negative impact on your customer acquisition efficiency. With more competition and lower attention spans, users get frustrated after waiting just two seconds for a page to load.\\n*   **Customer acquisition cost (CAC)****.**\\xa0CAC measures the amount of money you’re spending to acquire each customer.

Search engine optimization (SEO)\\n\\nIf you have a product people regularly search for online, such as airline flights or shoes, search engines can be a great free channel for growth. When you’re optimizing your site to gain more organic traffic (traffic from search engines), the metrics you should be looking out for are:\\n\\n*   **Search volume.**\\xa0You can only grow with SEO if there are a lot of people looking for your product on search engines like Google or Bing. Understanding\\xa0keyword research\\xa0is useful for learning if the keywords you want to be ranked for can generate enough traffic for growth. If they can’t, you’ll never be able to use them to scale.\\n*   **Average ranking position.**\\xa0In your Google Analytics SEO report you can see the average position of the keywords that are bringing you traffic. Position 1 means you’re the first result in Google for that keyword—the one that generates the most traffic.\\n*   **Bounce rate.**\\xa0If someone comes to your site through a Google search result and their expectations aren’t met, they’ll leave and your bounce rate will increase. Google uses bounce rates as a measure for ranking too, so high bounce rates are not only bad for ecommerce sales, but for SEO as well.\\n*   **Conversion rate.**\\xa0If you have a steady volume of visitors coming from organic traffic, you want to make sure you’re converting them into buyers as frequently as possible. Optimize your entire conversion funnel, from landing page to payment, to better leverage\\xa0ecommerce SEO\\xa0to grow sales.\\n*   **Revenue.**\\xa0You want to generate sales and revenue from visitors finding you through search.

Search engine marketing (SEM)\\n\\nAdvertising on search engines can help attract the right audience to your site. Work on both SEO and SEM strategies—they complement each other well. The metrics listed below are based on Google Ads, the search engine’s advertising solution:\\n\\n*   **Search volume.**\\xa0If you’re investing in search engine marketing you want to make sure, as with SEO, that the keywords you’re targeting have high traffic volume. Research through\\xa0Keyword Planner\\xa0before you start investing in SEM.\\n*   **Cost per click (CPC).**\\xa0You can control how much you’re willing to pay per click in SEM by adjusting your CPC in your Google Ads dashboard. The more you pay per click, the higher your ad will show in your prospective customer’s search results, which will generate more traffic.\\xa0\\n*   **Average ranking position.**\\xa0This metric, shown in your\\xa0Google Ads dashboard, is directly related to CPC. The more you spend on your keywords’ CPC, the higher your ranking position will be, which will generate more traffic.\\n*   **Click-through rate (CTR).**\\xa0Your ad may get shown to a lot of people, but it will only be effective if the right people click on it. Make sure your ad copy is enticing to your target customer. This will raise your CTR (also shown in your Google Ads dashboard) and generate more traffic.\\n*   **Bounce rate.**\\xa0If people are clicking on your ads but you’re still seeing high bounce rates, work on your landing pages and ads to make sure the message you’re telling is consistent. Monitor bounce rates for every SEM campaign in your Google Ads dashboard.\\n*   **Conversion rate.**\\xa0Optimizing your SEM conversion rate will have a big impact on your profits. Be sure your entire conversion funnel, from the landing page to payment, is optimized to better leverage SEM for sales. You can find the conversion rate of each campaign in your Google Ads dashboard.\\n*   **Customer acquisition cost (CAC).**\\xa0In Google Ads, CAC is calculated based on your average conversion rate and average cost per click. For example, if your conversion rate is 10%, that means you need 10 clicks to make one sale. If every click costs $2, your CAC will be $20. If a customer acquisition cost of $20 is too high for you to make a profit, you’ll be losing money while you generate sales.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Facebook and Instagram ads\\n\\nLeveraging advertising on social media can be tricky—people use social networks to connect with friends, not buy products. Still, social media is where people spend most of their time online, and Facebook is the most popular platform, so it’s worth experimenting with Facebook ads to grow sales. The main metrics used in Facebook advertising are:\\n\\n*   **Impressions.**\\xa0If your ad has a low number of impressions, it’s not being shown to enough people. This means your\\xa0target market\\xa0is too narrow.

The bigger your list, the better your chances of making a sale.

There are two aspects to this. First, you need a list of people who will be inclined to buy from you. Second, you need to work on the content of your emails to make that happen. Read more about these two metrics below.\\n*   **Conversion rate from visitors to email subscribers.**\\xa0Building a list requires adding forms to your website and asking people to subscribe. The conversion from visitors to subscribers will depend on how well you can convince visitors to sign up.\\n*   **Conversion rate from subscribers to sales.**\\xa0Once you have built a list of people interested in your products, you want to send them regular emails that are interesting and entertaining, and that will convince them to buy from you. Work on the designs of your emails and your selection of products to make sure you sell to your list.\\n*   **Open rate.**\\xa0If people don’t open your emails, there is no chance of you selling to them. A quality email list can generate open rates of 20% to 30%. Test your email subjects to make sure they are enticing and can convince people to open them.\\n*   **Click-through rate.**\\xa0Once your subscribers have opened your emails, you want them to click on a product, promotion, or piece of content and go back to your site to buy from you. The percentage of people that click on a link in an email is the click-through rate.\\n*   **Unsubscribe rate.**\\xa0If you’re not careful with the type of content you send to your list, people may unsubscribe. If too many people (more than 1%) unsubscribe, it’s a sign you’re not sending them what they signed up for.\\n\\nIn the next section, we’ll look at how to tie together everything we’ve discussed so far and incorporate ecommerce data analytics in your company’s routine.\\n\\nTips for ecommerce analytics success\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n*   Set your objectives beforehand\\n*   Establish benchmarks\\xa0\\n*   Optimize your campaigns\\xa0\\n*   Incorporate data into your company’s routine\\xa0\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Whether you’re a solo entrepreneur or part of a team, all you need to do is implement weekly check-ups.\\n\\nSuccessful companies focus on solving their biggest bottlenecks first. Start every week by opening your analytics and taking a clear view of what your priorities and marketing initiatives need to be for the coming days.\\n\\nBy understanding, for example, that your average page load time is high in comparison to your peers (or your previous week), and that page load time directly impacts conversions, you’ll know that its reduction should be a top priority for you.\\n\\nAs you can see in the example above, conversion rates are a big problem for this store.

Imagine using different channels like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and email marketing. Each platform provides data in different formats and standards, which makes it difficult to consolidate the information for a comprehensive analysis. Route all your data into one platform and format to better understand and act on your data.\\xa0\\n*   **Data privacy.**\\xa0Ensuring data privacy and security is critical. Failure to do so can lead to legal consequences and break trust with customers. Make sure you use secure data storage and do regular compliance checks to guarantee ongoing protection.\\xa0\\n*   **Data quality.**\\xa0Poor quality data, like incorrect, incomplete, or outdated information, can misguide your decisions. Imagine making inventory decisions based on inaccurate sales data. You’d be over or understocking products and negatively impacting profitability.\\xa0\\n*   **Cherry-picking data.**\\xa0Cherry-picking data means focusing on data points that support a particular conclusion, while ignoring or excluding other relevant data. Imagine you're running an online clothing store and analyzing sales data to decide what products to promote. You might cherry-pick data to focus solely on a successful winter jacket sales week, ignoring the overall decline throughout the entire season.\\n\\nAddressing these challenges lets you improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your\\xa0ecommerce KPIs. Once you become fluent in analytics, you can tell your own stories from the numbers you see and improve them.\\xa0\\n\\nUsing the best ecommerce analytics tools to improve your store\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMost businesses don’t fail due to lack of work or dedication—they fail due to executing the wrong things. The trick is to understand which data points are important for each development stage and to use that knowledge to make changes that will actually have a deep impact on your bottom line.\\n\\nUse Shopify's built-in\\xa0reporting and analytics\\xa0to make more informed decisions, faster.

If you’re entering an established market, include a list of a few companies you consider direct competitors and explain how you plan to differentiate your products and business from theirs.\\n\\nFor example, if you’re selling jewelry, your competitive differentiation could be that, unlike many high-end competitors, you donate a percentage of your profits to a notable charity or pass savings on to your customers.\\n\\nIf you’re entering a market where you can’t easily identify direct competitors, consider your indirect competitors—companies offering products that are substitutes for yours. For example, if you’re selling an innovative new piece of kitchen equipment, it’s too easy to say that because your product is new, you have no competition. Consider what your potential customers are doing to solve the same problems.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The last thing you want is for time and effort to go down the drain. Avoid these common mistakes:\\n\\n*   **Bad business idea.** Sometimes your idea may be too risky for potential investors, too expensive to run, or there’s no market. Aim for small business ideas that require low startup costs.\\n*   **No exit strategy.** If you don’t show an exit strategy, or a plan for investors to leave the business with maximum profits, you’ll have little luck finding capital.\\n*   **Unbalanced teams.** A great product is the cost of entry to starting a business. But an incredible team will take it to the top. Unfortunately, many business owners overlook a balanced team. They focus on potential profits, without worrying about how it will be done.\\xa0\\n*   **Missing financial projections.** Don’t leave out your balance sheet, cash flow statements, P&L statements, and income statements. Include your break-even analysis and return-on-investment calculations in your financial projections to create a successful business plan.\\n*   **Spelling and grammar errors.** All the best organizations have an editor review their documents. If someone spots typos while reading your business plan, how can they believe you’ll run a successful company?\\n\\nPrepare your business plan today\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n!Two people work together on a laptopA business plan can help you identify clear, deliberate next steps for your business, even if you never plan to pitch investors—and it can help you see gaps in your plan before they become issues.\\xa0\\n\\nWhether you’re working on starting a new online business idea, building a retail storefront, growing your established business, or purchasing an existing business, you now understand how to write a business plan that suits your business’s goals and needs.\\n\\n_Feature illustration by Rachel Tunstall_\\n\\nBusiness plan FAQ\\n-----------------\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Definition and Guide (2023)\\nUnderstanding your customers is critical to success. It allows you to create messaging and offers that resonate with your audience, rather than guessing about their preferences and needs.\\n\\nAnd taking it a step further, segmenting customers into groups based on similarities helps you develop a deeper understanding of those groups. You can then build targeted campaigns addressing each segment’s specific needs. Pretty cool, right?\\n\\nSo, what exactly\\xa0_is_\\xa0customer segmentation and how do you do it? Let’s take a look.\\n\\nWhat is customer segmentation?\\n------------------------------\\n\\nCustomer segmentation is the process of dividing a company’s customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.\\n\\nIn business-to-business marketing, a company might segment customers based on a wide range of factors, including:\\n\\n*   Industry\\n*   Number of employees\\n*   Products previously purchased from the company\\n*   Location\\n\\nIn business-to-consumer marketing, companies often segment customers according to demographics that include:\\n\\n*   Age\\n*   Gender\\n*   Marital status\\n*   Location (urban, suburban, rural)\\n*   Life stage (single, married, divorced, empty-nester, retired, etc.)\\n\\nWhy segment customers?\\n----------------------\\n\\nSegmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Those efforts can relate to both communications and product development. Specifically, segmentation helps a company:\\n\\n*   Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers, but not with others (who will receive messages tailored to their needs and interests instead)\\n*   Select the best communication channel for the segment, which might be email, social media posts, radio advertising, or another approach, depending on the segment\\n*   Identify ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities\\n*   Establish better customer relationships\\n*   Test pricing options\\n*   Focus on the most profitable customers\\n*   Improve customer service\\n*   Upsell and cross-sell other products and services\\n\\nHow to segment customers\\n------------------------\\n\\nCustomer segmentation requires a company to gather specific data about customers and analyze it to identify patterns that can be used to create groupings.\\n\\nSome customer data can be gathered from purchasing information—job title, geography, or products purchased, for example. Some of it might be gleaned from how the customer entered your system.\\n\\nAn online marketer working from an opt-in email list might segment marketing messages according to the opt-in offer that attracted the customer, for example. Other information, however, including consumer demographics such as age and marital status, will need to be acquired in other ways.\\n\\nTypical information-gathering methods include:\\n\\n*   Face-to-face or telephone interviews\\n*   Surveys\\n*   General research using published information about market categories\\n*   Focus groups\\n*   Loyalty program data\\n*   In-person conversations\\n*   Customer reviews\\n*   POS data\\n*   Customer support interactions\\n*   Purchase history\\n*   Online analytics\\n\\nWith\\xa0Shopify’s segmentation tools, you can collect this data directly from your online store traffic. Discover powerful insights about your customers by creating unique segments and then reach out with personalized campaigns to drive sales.\\n\\nShopify also includes\\xa0some default customer segments and templates to help you get started. You can refine, add, or even remove customer segments over time as your business evolves. Build your customer segments in the editor on the Customers page by\\xa0adding filter names, operators, and values.\\n\\nUsing customer segments\\n-----------------------\\n\\nCommon characteristics in customer segments can guide how a company markets to individual segments and what products or services it promotes to them.\\n\\nA small business selling handmade guitars, for example, might decide to promote lower-priced products to younger guitarists and higher-priced premium guitars to older musicians based on segment knowledge that tells them younger musicians have less disposable income than their older counterparts. Similarly, a meals-by-mail service might emphasize convenience to millennial customers and “tastes like mother used to make” benefits to baby boomers.\\n\\nOnce you’ve identified your segments, list their shared characteristics, paying careful attention to pain points and desires. Lean into those commonalities when developing your segmented marketing strategies and promotions. You don’t have to offer every promo to every customer—send your promos only to those who will be interested. A discount on dog food surely isn’t going to drive any sales from your customers who don’t own dogs, for example. So consider creating a segment of dog owners and only send those promos to them.\\n\\nThe main idea behind a customer segmentation strategy is you don’t need to send every promotion to every person all the time. Instead, send targeted promotions to relevant audiences.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can put customers into multiple segments—you don’t have to pigeonhole everyone into just a single group. For example, people in your dog owner segment may also be in your parents’ segment.\\n\\nThe customer segmentation model can be used by all businesses regardless of size or industry and whether they sell online or in person. It begins with gathering and analyzing data and ends with acting on the information gathered in a way that is appropriate and effective.\\n\\nCustomer segmentation examples\\n------------------------------\\n\\nExamples of\\xa0customer segments to build\\xa0include:\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

That way, you can understand customers’ actions, better serve them, and increase sales.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat is ecommerce analytics?\\n----------------------------\\n\\nEcommerce analytics is the process of discovering, interpreting, and communicating data patterns related to online business. Ecommerce analytics helps measure customer behavior, performance trends, and ROI.\\n\\nUnderstanding ecommerce analytics\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nMarketers use analytics to show return on investment (ROI) for campaigns and make better decisions to increase sales, reduce costs, and make business improvements.\\xa0\\n\\nEcommerce analytics\\xa0helps centralize and manage data.\\xa0Siva K. Balasubramanian, associate dean and professor of marketing at Illinois Tech’s Stuart School of Business, explains that the onset of multiple data sources to gather and merge data about customers, products, and markets is a common problem for today’s businesses.\\xa0\\n\\n“Analytics offers useful techniques to handle this problem by organizing data to develop metrics that are most useful for continuously monitoring business performance,” Balasubramanian says. “The focus of analytics is on issues that matter most to the business, and the performance metrics are helpful in identifying and solving problems in real time.”\\n\\nData points can tell you a story about the total number of visitors to your site in a given week. For example, maybe only 50% enjoyed your website enough to spend more than even a few seconds on it. And maybe only half of those who stayed actually made a purchase, while another 10% got stuck in the checkout process, became frustrated, and left.\\n\\nThat’s the story of a group of individuals who took very different actions on your online store.\\xa0\\n\\nUntil you know the\\xa0_whole_\\xa0story, you can’t change the ending.

For example, maybe only 50% enjoyed your website enough to spend more than even a few seconds on it. And maybe only half of those who stayed actually made a purchase, while another 10% got stuck in the checkout process, became frustrated, and left.\\n\\nThat’s the story of a group of individuals who took very different actions on your online store.\\xa0\\n\\nUntil you know the\\xa0_whole_\\xa0story, you can’t change the ending.

For example, if your typical client comes back to your store three times to buy something, spends, on average, $100 per purchase, and your\\xa0profit margin\\xa0is 10% ($10), that customer’s CLV is $30.\\xa0\\n*   **Returning visitors.**\\xa0The percentage of users who return to your site after their first visit. This number is a clear indication that people liked what they saw.\\xa0\\n*   **Time on site.**\\xa0The average amount of time users spend on your site per visit. If people are spending time on your site, it shows they’re having a good customer experience.\\n*   **Pages per visit.**\\xa0The average number of pages users navigate on your site in a single visit. A high number of pages per visit (around four) indicates people are interested in what you’re selling.\\n*   **Bounce rate.**\\xa0The percentage of users who visit a single page on your website and leave before taking any action. A high bounce rate (usually higher than 57%) means your site is not giving a good first impression. A user may bounce because of poor design, unmet expectations, or slow page-loading time.\\n\\nWith the exception of CLV, which you need to calculate yourself, the above metrics can easily be accessed through\\xa0Google Analytics. They appear on the first page, as soon as you log in.\\n\\nIf any of your metrics are below average, try putting yourself in the shoes of your customer, brainstorm ideas for improving your site, and test solutions until you see those numbers start moving up.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Your goal during the customer acquisition efficiency phase is ensuring your website is easy to navigate and quick to load so visitors have the best possible user experience.\\n\\nThe main metrics to watch while improving your customer acquisition efficiency are:\\n\\n*   **Conversion rate.**\\xa0The percentage of people that visited your website and either signed up or made a purchase is called the conversion rate. This is an important number, because the lower your conversion rate, the more expensive and time consuming it will be to make a sale. On average, the\\xa0ecommerce conversion rate\\xa0for stores is between 1% and 4%.\\n*   **Page load time.**\\xa0When your pages take too long to load, conversion rates will be affected, which will have a negative impact on your customer acquisition efficiency. With more competition and lower attention spans, users get frustrated after waiting just two seconds for a page to load.\\n*   **Customer acquisition cost (CAC)****.**\\xa0CAC measures the amount of money you’re spending to acquire each customer. Since customer acquisition is the main expenditure in ecommerce, if your CAC is higher than the lifetime value of a customer, you will be operating at a loss.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Understanding\\xa0keyword research\\xa0is useful for learning if the keywords you want to be ranked for can generate enough traffic for growth. If they can’t, you’ll never be able to use them to scale.\\n*   **Average ranking position.**\\xa0In your Google Analytics SEO report you can see the average position of the keywords that are bringing you traffic. Position 1 means you’re the first result in Google for that keyword—the one that generates the most traffic.\\n*   **Bounce rate.**\\xa0If someone comes to your site through a Google search result and their expectations aren’t met, they’ll leave and your bounce rate will increase. Google uses bounce rates as a measure for ranking too, so high bounce rates are not only bad for ecommerce sales, but for SEO as well.\\n*   **Conversion rate.**\\xa0If you have a steady volume of visitors coming from organic traffic, you want to make sure you’re converting them into buyers as frequently as possible. Optimize your entire conversion funnel, from landing page to payment, to better leverage\\xa0ecommerce SEO\\xa0to grow sales.\\n*   **Revenue.**\\xa0You want to generate sales and revenue from visitors finding you through search.

The metrics listed below are based on Google Ads, the search engine’s advertising solution:\\n\\n*   **Search volume.**\\xa0If you’re investing in search engine marketing you want to make sure, as with SEO, that the keywords you’re targeting have high traffic volume. Research through\\xa0Keyword Planner\\xa0before you start investing in SEM.\\n*   **Cost per click (CPC).**\\xa0You can control how much you’re willing to pay per click in SEM by adjusting your CPC in your Google Ads dashboard. The more you pay per click, the higher your ad will show in your prospective customer’s search results, which will generate more traffic.\\xa0\\n*   **Average ranking position.**\\xa0This metric, shown in your\\xa0Google Ads dashboard, is directly related to CPC. The more you spend on your keywords’ CPC, the higher your ranking position will be, which will generate more traffic.\\n*   **Click-through rate (CTR).**\\xa0Your ad may get shown to a lot of people, but it will only be effective if the right people click on it. Make sure your ad copy is enticing to your target customer. This will raise your CTR (also shown in your Google Ads dashboard) and generate more traffic.\\n*   **Bounce rate.**\\xa0If people are clicking on your ads but you’re still seeing high bounce rates, work on your landing pages and ads to make sure the message you’re telling is consistent. Monitor bounce rates for every SEM campaign in your Google Ads dashboard.\\n*   **Conversion rate.**\\xa0Optimizing your SEM conversion rate will have a big impact on your profits. Be sure your entire conversion funnel, from the landing page to payment, is optimized to better leverage SEM for sales. You can find the conversion rate of each campaign in your Google Ads dashboard.\\n*   **Customer acquisition cost (CAC).**\\xa0In Google Ads, CAC is calculated based on your average conversion rate and average cost per click. For example, if your conversion rate is 10%, that means you need 10 clicks to make one sale. If every click costs $2, your CAC will be $20. If a customer acquisition cost of $20 is too high for you to make a profit, you’ll be losing money while you generate sales.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Facebook and Instagram ads\\n\\nLeveraging advertising on social media can be tricky—people use social networks to connect with friends, not buy products. Still, social media is where people spend most of their time online, and Facebook is the most popular platform, so it’s worth experimenting with Facebook ads to grow sales. The main metrics used in Facebook advertising are:\\n\\n*   **Impressions.**\\xa0If your ad has a low number of impressions, it’s not being shown to enough people. This means your\\xa0target market\\xa0is too narrow. Widen your audience by including more relevant interests or demographics.\\n*   **CTR.**\\xa0This is the percentage of people clicking on your ad after seeing it. If your CTR is too low, the messaging or design of your ads need some work, or you’re showing your ads to the wrong audience.\\n*   **Cost per click (CPC).**\\xa0On Facebook, a click will cost more depending on the type of audience you’re targeting. A high\\xa0CPC\\xa0will translate into higher CAC.\\n*   **Bounce rate.**\\xa0Bounce rate works the same with Facebook as it does with SEM.\\n*   **Conversion rate.**\\xa0Conversion rate is an important metric, and each advertising campaign may have a different conversion rate. If you identified a particular campaign with a bad conversion rate (in Google Analytics, go to Acquisition > Campaigns to find out), work on your landing pages and ads to make sure they both have a consistent and clear message, highlighting the value of your products.\\n*   **CAC.**\\xa0CAC also works the same with Facebook as it does with SEM.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Email marketing\\n\\nEmail marketing is, on average, the best performing channel for sales in ecommerce. The challenge is building an email list, which takes time. The main metrics you should be watching for when leveraging email campaigns are:\\n\\n*   **Number of email subscribers.**\\xa0If you want to grow sales by using email, numbers matter. The bigger your list, the better your chances of making a sale. Work on getting as many email subscribers as possible from your potential clients.\\n*   **Sales from email.**\\xa0Simply having a big list of email addresses isn’t enough—you need to be able to sell to them. There are two aspects to this. First, you need a list of people who will be inclined to buy from you. Second, you need to work on the content of your emails to make that happen. Read more about these two metrics below.\\n*   **Conversion rate from visitors to email subscribers.**\\xa0Building a list requires adding forms to your website and asking people to subscribe. The conversion from visitors to subscribers will depend on how well you can convince visitors to sign up.\\n*   **Conversion rate from subscribers to sales.**\\xa0Once you have built a list of people interested in your products, you want to send them regular emails that are interesting and entertaining, and that will convince them to buy from you. Work on the designs of your emails and your selection of products to make sure you sell to your list.\\n*   **Open rate.**\\xa0If people don’t open your emails, there is no chance of you selling to them. A quality email list can generate open rates of 20% to 30%. Test your email subjects to make sure they are enticing and can convince people to open them.\\n*   **Click-through rate.**\\xa0Once your subscribers have opened your emails, you want them to click on a product, promotion, or piece of content and go back to your site to buy from you. The percentage of people that click on a link in an email is the click-through rate.\\n*   **Unsubscribe rate.**\\xa0If you’re not careful with the type of content you send to your list, people may unsubscribe. If too many people (more than 1%) unsubscribe, it’s a sign you’re not sending them what they signed up for.\\n\\nIn the next section, we’ll look at how to tie together everything we’ve discussed so far and incorporate ecommerce data analytics in your company’s routine.\\n\\nTips for ecommerce analytics success\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n*   Set your objectives beforehand\\n*   Establish benchmarks\\xa0\\n*   Optimize your campaigns\\xa0\\n*   Incorporate data into your company’s routine\\xa0\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Whether you’re a solo entrepreneur or part of a team, all you need to do is implement weekly check-ups.\\n\\nSuccessful companies focus on solving their biggest bottlenecks first. Start every week by opening your analytics and taking a clear view of what your priorities and marketing initiatives need to be for the coming days.\\n\\nBy understanding, for example, that your average page load time is high in comparison to your peers (or your previous week), and that page load time directly impacts conversions, you’ll know that its reduction should be a top priority for you.\\n\\nAs you can see in the example above, conversion rates are a big problem for this store. It should be focusing its efforts on optimizing its landing pages, store experience, and\\xa0sales funnel\\xa0to improve its conversion numbers and sell more.\\n\\nYou can also simply keep track of your metrics in a spreadsheet or on a whiteboard. The important thing is to prioritize. If you want to improve your numbers over time, always compare your data with the previous week.\\n\\nOnce you identify your biggest problems, brainstorm ideas that can positively impact the red metrics on your dashboard. Put these ideas into action and follow the same checkup the next week to verify if your numbers have improved. Repeat this process every week until all of your metrics are green.\\n\\nThat’s it. When you’re fluent in analytics and incorporate ecommerce data into the decision-making process of your company, nothing can stop you.\\n\\nCommon challenges around ecommerce analytics\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere are a few challenges you might face when doing ecommerce data analysis:\\xa0\\n\\n*   **Data inconsistency.**\\xa0Combining data from different sources can make analysis tough. Imagine using different channels like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and email marketing. Each platform provides data in different formats and standards, which makes it difficult to consolidate the information for a comprehensive analysis. Route all your data into one platform and format to better understand and act on your data.\\xa0\\n*   **Data privacy.**\\xa0Ensuring data privacy and security is critical. Failure to do so can lead to legal consequences and break trust with customers. Make sure you use secure data storage and do regular compliance checks to guarantee ongoing protection.\\xa0\\n*   **Data quality.**\\xa0Poor quality data, like incorrect, incomplete, or outdated information, can misguide your decisions. Imagine making inventory decisions based on inaccurate sales data. You’d be over or understocking products and negatively impacting profitability.\\xa0\\n*   **Cherry-picking data.**\\xa0Cherry-picking data means focusing on data points that support a particular conclusion, while ignoring or excluding other relevant data. Imagine you're running an online clothing store and analyzing sales data to decide what products to promote. You might cherry-pick data to focus solely on a successful winter jacket sales week, ignoring the overall decline throughout the entire season.\\n\\nAddressing these challenges lets you improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your\\xa0ecommerce KPIs. Once you become fluent in analytics, you can tell your own stories from the numbers you see and improve them.\\xa0\\n\\nUsing the best ecommerce analytics tools to improve your store\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMost businesses don’t fail due to lack of work or dedication—they fail due to executing the wrong things. The trick is to understand which data points are important for each development stage and to use that knowledge to make changes that will actually have a deep impact on your bottom line.\\n\\nUse Shopify's built-in\\xa0reporting and analytics\\xa0to make more informed decisions, faster. Choose from over 60 pre-built dashboards and reports, or customize your own to spot trends, capitalize on opportunities, and supercharge your decision-making.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Analytics platforms allow businesses to uncover trends and patterns in their data, helping them understand how their business is performing in the present and future. By using marketing analytics, businesses can condense data and make it visible in a short amount of time, gaining insights such as the number of website visitors, visitor actions, popular pages during busy shopping seasons, and the devices used by visitors. Ecommerce analytics tools, such as Shopify's reporting and analytics, can be used to improve a store's performance by providing pre-built dashboards and reports to spot trends, capitalize on
